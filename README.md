# Bulls and Cows
Also known as *Cows and Bulls* or *Pigs and Bulls* or *Bulls and Cleots* -- is an old code-breaking paper and pencil game for two players, predating the similar commercially-marketed board game *Mastermind*.

It is a game with numbers that may date back a century or more. It is played by two opponents. The game can also be played with 3 digits instead of 4.

On a sheet of paper, the players each write a 4-digit secret number. The digits must be all different. Then, in turn, the players try to guess their opponent's number who gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are on their right positions, they are __"bulls"__, if on different positions, they are __"cows"__. Example:

_Secret number: 4271_

_Opponent's try: 1234_

_Answer: 1 bull and 2 cows._ (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".)

The first one to reveal the other's secret number wins the game. As the "first one to try" has a logical advantage, on every game the "first" player changes. In some places, the winner of the previous game will play "second". Sometimes, if the "first" player finds the number, the "second" has one more move to make and if he also succeeds, the result is even.

The secret numbers for bulls and cows are usually 4-digit-numbers, but the game can be played with 3 to 6 digit numbers (in every case it is more difficult than with 4).

The game may also be played by two teams of 2-3 players. The players of every team discuss before making their move, much like in chess.

It's proven that any number could be solved for up to seven turns. Minimal average game length is 26274/5040=5.2131 turns
